Title: Flatmates Bill

Description: This app takes the bill amount as an input for a particular period and number of days each of the
two flatmates stayed in the apartment. This app returns the share of each of the flatmates based on the number of days
each flatmate stayed in the house. It also generated a PDF report including the period of the bill and the share of each
flatmate.
